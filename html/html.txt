lecture - 10
in this part we will study about diffrent types of list
1) ordered list(<ol><li></li></ol>) - in this we write numbered list
ex input --  <h1><strong>Lists</strong></h1>
    <ol><li>item 1</li>
    <li>item 2</li>
    <li>item 3</li>
    <li>item 4</li>
    </ol>
    output -- Lists
               1.item 1
               2.item 2
               3.item 3
               4.item 4
2) unordered list(<ul><li></li></ul>) - in this we write bulletin list
 ex input -- <h1><strong>Lists</strong></h1>
                    <ul><li>item 1</li>
                    <li>item 2</li>
                    <li>item 3</li>
                    <li>item 4</li>
                    </ul>
    output -- Lists
               *item 1
               *item 2
               *item 3
               *item 4
3)nested list(<ol><li></li><ul><li></li></ul></ol> or <ul><li></li><ol><li></li></ol></ul) -
 example-- input -- <ol> <li>item 1</li>
                         <li> item 2</li>
                         <ul><li>nested 1</li>
                             <li> nested 2</li>
                              <ul><li>dual nested 1</li></ul>
                         </ul></ul></ol>
           output -- 1.item 1
                     2.item 2
                        *nested 1
                        *nested 2
                           *dual nested 1
